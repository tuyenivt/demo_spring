# Temporal Demo

## Overview

A Temporal Java demo project demonstrating workflow orchestration with:
- Saga pattern for distributed transactions
- Workflow signals and queries
- Activity heartbeat for long operations
- Search attributes for workflow discovery
- Workflow versioning for safe deployments
- Rate limiting and graceful shutdown
- Durable timers with `Workflow.sleep()`
- Human-in-the-loop approval with `Workflow.await()`
- Cron/scheduled workflows replacing `@Scheduled`
- Continue-As-New for long-running polling workflows
- Non-retryable exceptions for permanent failures

## Quick Start

1. Start Temporal with docker

   ```bash
   docker run -d --name temporal --user root -p 7233:7233 -p 8233:8233 -v temporal-data:/data temporalio/temporal:1.5.1 server start-dev --ip 0.0.0.0 --db-filename /data/temporal.db
   ```

2. Run the Application

   ```bash
   ./gradlew :temporal:bootRun
   ```

3. API Tests

- Start a workflow (async - recommended)

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/orders \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"customerId":"CUST-123","amount":9999,"description":"Premium Widget"}'
   ```

- Start a workflow (sync - for quick demo only)

   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/orders/sync \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"customerId":"CUST-456","amount":5000,"description":"Basic Widget"}'
   ```

- Check workflow status
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8080/api/orders/ORD-XXXXXXXX/status
   ```

## Testing

Run workflow unit tests:

```bash
./gradlew :temporal:test
```

Tests use `TestWorkflowEnvironment` for isolated testing with mocked activities.

## API Reference

### Order Workflow

| Method | Endpoint                                 | Description                              |
|--------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| POST   | `/api/orders`                            | Start order workflow (async)             |
| POST   | `/api/orders/sync`                       | Start order workflow (sync, demo only)   |
| GET    | `/api/orders/{orderId}/status`           | Get workflow execution status            |
| POST   | `/api/orders/{orderId}/cancel`           | Send cancel signal (returns 202)         |
| PUT    | `/api/orders/{orderId}/shipping-address` | Send address update signal (returns 202) |
| GET    | `/api/orders/{orderId}/shipping-address` | Query current shipping address           |

```bash
# Cancel a running order
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/orders/ORD-XXXXXXXX/cancel \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"reason":"Customer request"}'

# Update shipping address
curl -X PUT http://localhost:8080/api/orders/ORD-XXXXXXXX/shipping-address \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"address":"123 New Street, Springfield"}'

# Query shipping address
curl http://localhost:8080/api/orders/ORD-XXXXXXXX/shipping-address
```

### Approval Workflow (Human-in-the-Loop)

Demonstrates `Workflow.await()` — the workflow pauses and waits up to 24 hours for a manager decision.

| Method | Endpoint                                      | Description             |
|--------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| POST   | `/api/approvals?orderId=&customerId=&amount=` | Start approval workflow |
| POST   | `/api/approvals/{orderId}/approve`            | Send approve signal     |
| POST   | `/api/approvals/{orderId}/reject`             | Send reject signal      |
| GET    | `/api/approvals/{orderId}/status`             | Query approval status   |

```bash
# Start approval (workflow pauses waiting for decision)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/approvals?orderId=ORD-123&customerId=CUST-1&amount=9999"

# Approve
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/approvals/ORD-123/approve \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"note":"Approved by manager"}'

# Reject
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/approvals/ORD-123/reject \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"reason":"Amount exceeds limit"}'

# Query status (PENDING_APPROVAL / APPROVED / REJECTED / AUTO_REJECTED)
curl http://localhost:8080/api/approvals/ORD-123/status
```

### Report Workflow (Cron)

Demonstrates Temporal as a replacement for `@Scheduled` and cron jobs — durable, distributed, deduped.

| Method | Endpoint             | Description                          |
|--------|----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| POST   | `/api/reports/start` | Start daily cron workflow (9 AM UTC) |
| DELETE | `/api/reports/stop`  | Terminate the cron workflow          |

```bash
# Start cron (runs daily at 9 AM UTC, persists until stopped)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/reports/start

# Stop cron
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:8080/api/reports/stop
```

| Signals           | Cancel order, update shipping address during processing                          |
| Queries           | Read order status and shipping address (read-only, immediate)                    |
| Heartbeat         | Long-running activities report progress and detect cancellation                  |
| Search Attributes | Filter workflows by customer, amount, status                                     |
| Versioning        | Safe deployments with backward compatibility (`Workflow.getVersion()`)           |
| Rate Limiting     | Prevent overwhelming external services                                           |
| Durable Timer     | `Workflow.sleep(24h)` shipping reminder — survives worker restarts               |
| Workflow.await()  | Human-in-the-loop approvals — workflow pauses waiting for signal                 |
| Cron Workflow     | `setCronSchedule()` replaces `@Scheduled` with durable distributed scheduling    |
| Continue-As-New   | `Workflow.continueAsNew()` resets history for long-running polling workflows     |
| Non-Retryable     | `ApplicationFailure.newNonRetryableFailure()` skips retries for permanent errors |

## Key Patterns

### Non-Retryable Exceptions

Not all failures should be retried. `OrderValidationException` represents a permanent business rule
violation — retrying will always produce the same result.

```java
// In activity: fail immediately, skip all retries
throw ApplicationFailure.newNonRetryableFailure(
    "Invalid amount: " + amount,
    OrderValidationException.class.getName());

// In workflow RetryOptions: declare which exceptions are non-retryable
RetryOptions.newBuilder()
    .setDoNotRetry(OrderValidationException.class.getName())
    .build()
```

### Durable Timer (`Workflow.sleep`)

Unlike `Thread.sleep()`, `Workflow.sleep()` is persisted in Temporal's event history and **survives
worker restarts**. In `TestWorkflowEnvironment`, time is skipped instantly — no real waiting.

```java
// Send confirmation, then wait 24h for shipping reminder
activities.sendNotification(customerId, "Order confirmed!");
Workflow.sleep(Duration.ofHours(24)); // durable — survives restarts
activities.sendNotification(customerId, "Your order ships today!");
```

### Human-in-the-Loop (`Workflow.await`)

`Workflow.await(timeout, condition)` pauses the workflow until an external signal arrives or the
timeout expires. The pause is fully durable.

```java
// Workflow pauses here — survives restarts while waiting
boolean decided = Workflow.await(Duration.ofHours(24), () -> approved || rejected);
if (!decided) { /* auto-reject after timeout */ }
```

### Cron Workflow

```java
WorkflowOptions.newBuilder()
    .setCronSchedule("0 9 * * *")   // 9 AM UTC daily
    .setWorkflowId("daily-report")  // only one runs at a time
    .build()

// Access result of previous run (for incremental processing)
var lastResult = Workflow.getLastCompletionResult(String.class);
```

### Continue-As-New

Prevents unbounded event history growth in long-running workflows. After N iterations, start a fresh
run with the same workflow ID, passing accumulated state as arguments.

```java
if (currentRunIterations >= HISTORY_RESET_THRESHOLD) {
    // Terminates current run, starts new run with these args
    Workflow.continueAsNew(targetId, totalIterations);
}
```
