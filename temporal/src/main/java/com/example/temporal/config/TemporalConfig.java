/**
 * Temporal configuration for Spring Boot with graceful shutdown support.
 * <p>
 * GRACEFUL SHUTDOWN FLOW:
 * 1. Kubernetes sends SIGTERM to pod
 * 2. Spring Boot stops accepting new HTTP requests
 * 3. WorkerFactory.shutdown() initiates worker shutdown
 * 4. Workers stop polling NORMAL task queue for new tasks
 * 5. Workers continue polling STICKY task queue (for cached workflows) until drain timeout
 * 6. Active workflow tasks complete (up to sticky drain timeout)
 * 7. Active activity tasks complete
 * 8. Workers shutdown cleanly after all tasks finish or timeout
 * 9. Service stubs close connections
 * 10. Application exits
 * <p>
 * STICKY TASK QUEUE EXPLAINED:
 * - Temporal caches workflow state on workers for performance
 * - Cached workflows receive tasks via "sticky" task queue
 * - During shutdown, we want to complete these cached workflows
 * - setStickyTaskQueueDrainTimeout() allows time for this
 * <p>
 * This ensures:
 * - No workflows are interrupted mid-execution
 * - Cached workflows complete gracefully
 * - In-flight HTTP requests complete
 * - No data loss or corruption

    /**
     * Creates and starts workers that poll for tasks.
     * <p>
     * Workers are responsible for:
     * 1. Polling task queues for workflow tasks and activity tasks
     * 2. Executing workflow code (deterministic orchestration)
     * 3. Executing activity code (non-deterministic I/O operations)
     * <p>
     * GRACEFUL SHUTDOWN with STICKY TASK QUEUE DRAIN:
     * <p>
     * The sticky task queue drain timeout is CRITICAL for graceful shutdown:
     * <p>
     * 1. Normal Operation:
     * - Worker polls NORMAL task queue for new workflows
     * - Worker polls STICKY task queue for cached workflows
     * - Cached workflows are faster (state already in memory)
     * <p>
     * 2. During Shutdown:
     * - Worker STOPS polling NORMAL task queue (no new workflows)
     * - Worker CONTINUES polling STICKY task queue (finish cached workflows)
     * - Drains sticky queue for up to setStickyTaskQueueDrainTimeout()
     * - Cached workflows complete gracefully
     * <p>
     * 3. Why This Matters:
     * - Workflows cached on this worker can complete
     * - No workflow interruption mid-execution
     * - Better resource utilization (workflows don't need to transfer)
     * - Cleaner shutdown (no orphaned cached state)
     * <p>
     * BEST PRACTICE:
     * - Set drain timeout to expected max workflow execution time
     * - Must be > RPC long poll timeout (default 60s)
     * - For this demo: 30s is sufficient for our workflows
