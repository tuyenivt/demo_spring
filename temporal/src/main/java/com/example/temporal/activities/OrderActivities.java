/**
 * Activity interface for order-related operations.
 * <p>
 * TEMPORAL CONCEPT: Activities
 * <p>
 * Activities are where you perform actual work:
 * - Database operations
 * - HTTP calls to external services
 * - File I/O
 * - Any non-deterministic operations
 * <p>
 * KEY DIFFERENCES FROM WORKFLOWS:
 * <p>
 * 1. ACTIVITIES CAN:
 * - Perform I/O operations
 * - Access databases
 * - Call external APIs
 * - Use current system time
 * - Generate random numbers
 * - Be non-deterministic
 * <p>
 * 2. WORKFLOWS CANNOT:
 * - Do any of the above directly
 * - Must use activities for all I/O
 * - Must be deterministic (same input → same output)
 * <p>
 * WHY THIS SEPARATION?
 * - Temporal can replay workflow code during recovery
 * - Non-deterministic code in workflows would produce different results on replay
 * - Activities are executed once, results are recorded in history
